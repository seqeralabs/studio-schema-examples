# Studio schema examples

This is a repository with examples of Seqera Studio schema definitions for various use cases.

This branch showcases an example of how to define a schema for a studio that can be built from a Dockerfile in this repository.  

Note: The Dockerfile and all its dependent files must be stored under the `.seqera` directory as it is used as the build context.  
The Dockerfile must reference files relative to `.seqera` (the build context).

For more details, see [latest official Seqera documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/platform-cloud/studios/add-studio-git-repo#create-the-required-configuration-files).
